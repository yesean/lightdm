# sean web-greeter theme

## General tips

1. Make sure you have node and npm on your machine. Run `npm i` prior to
   `install.sh` to install npm dependencies. This step is generally only
   necessary for first-time setup.
2. To attain the same settings as the unixporn post, you'll need to disable the
   splash text and enable rounded avatars.

### Do I really have to reboot after I modify and rebuild the theme to see my changes?

Well yes, but actually no if you just want to test out new stuff! Because of the
way Vue is built by npm, I don't think there's a good way to directly modify the
theme through, say, a .conf file. This being said, one way I tested changes
without having to recompile, log out, and log back in again was to simply look
at `dist/index.html` (this should appear after you build) to view the greeter in
my browser!

### I have multiple desktop environments and want to select one at login

Uncomment line 36 in `src/views/Login.vue` to turn on DE selection. I only use
Xfce so I removed this functionality since it was unnecessary for me.
